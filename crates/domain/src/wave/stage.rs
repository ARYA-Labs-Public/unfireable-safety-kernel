//! *wire-shape* tag the transparency-log persists per session record.
//! They must agree on the set of stages — the [`From`] impls below
//! pin the mapping at compile time.
//!
//! The transparency-log stores one [`WaveSessionRecord`] per (wave,
//! stage, `session_id`) tuple. A wave is "complete" only when records
//! exist for [`WaveStage::Tested`], [`WaveStage::Accepted`], and
//! [`WaveStage::Closed`] (plus [`WaveStage::PurpleTeamed`] if the wave
//! touched any gate surface).
