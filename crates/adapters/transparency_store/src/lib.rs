//! Append-only Merkle transparency-log storage adapter (ADR-014
//! Phase 3 §5, internal-ref Step 4).
//!
//! Two impls are provided:
//!
//!   - [`memory::MemoryTransparencyStore`] — `Arc<Mutex<...>>`-backed
//!     in-memory store. Used by the transparency-log service's unit
//!     tests, by the reconciler in dev, and by anyone who wants to
//!     wire the trait without standing up Postgres.
//!   - [`postgres::PgTransparencyStore`] — Postgres-backed production
//!     store. Uses `SERIALIZABLE` isolation per ADR-014 Phase 3 §5;
//!     `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO UPDATE ...
//!     RETURNING` guarantees that retried appends return the
//!     **existing** row's index rather than minting a new one (ADR §6
//!     idempotency demand).
//!
//! The trait itself is in this module so consumers can write
//! `Arc<dyn TransparencyStore>` without pulling in either impl.
//!
//! Boundary: this crate imports `sqlx`, `tokio`, `tracing` —
//! permissible because it's an adapter. The `qorch-domain` types it
//! references (`MerkleLeaf`, `InclusionProof`, `VerificationError`)
//! stay pure.
